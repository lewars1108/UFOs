# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to assist Dana, a data journalist who will be writing an article about her hometown of McMinnville, Oregon. McMinnville is famous for its sightings of UFOs, and Dana has decided to right her article on the topic. A table will be created to organize the UFO sighting data that Dana has acquired. The table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Results

Upon entering the site, users will first be able to read the article on UFOs.

 After learning some background information, users will be able to wander through filters to discover data of any date, city, state, or country (should the data be available). They will even be able to filter the shape of the UFO sighted.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback of the filters is that they are case sensitive and date inputs must match the current format. Some possible solutions for this drawback would be to check JavaScript equality settings or make these filters drop down so that only the information that is available can be displayed and users don't waste time searching for data that is not included.
